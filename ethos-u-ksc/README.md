#Train and Deploy your NPU-enabled models

Using the Arm® Corstone™-300 with Arm® Cortex™-M55 and Arm® Ethos™-U55 NPU.

## Summary
This notebook presents a flow to help bridge the gap between data scientists and embedded engineers.


The GHA workflow sets up a Python environment, installs required dependencies, executes a Jupyter Notebook to build a machine learning model, displays the model file contents, and finally updates a specific file in the repository with the latest model and a commit message reflecting the time of the update.
